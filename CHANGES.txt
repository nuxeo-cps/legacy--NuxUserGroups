0.8

  Added a patch to MembershipTool to provide the two safe methods
  setLocalGroupRoles and deleteLocalGroupRoles.

  Added the pseudo groups "role:Anonymous" to which everybody belongs,
  and "role:Authenticated" to which logged-in users belong. This makes
  it easy to use only local roles instead of changing the
  role/permission map, for everything that doesn't involve blocking
  permissions.
