Local roles blocking

  Standard local roles

    They are stored as a dictionnary mapping user to roles::

      {'user1': ['roleA', 'roleB'],
       'user2': ...,
       }

    In the following, the above roles are supposed to be specified at a
    higher level than the following examples.

  Blocking specific roles of a user

    A role prefixed by '-' means that this role should be blocked from
    acquired roles for that user. Roles prefixed by '-' are evaluated
    before others.

    Example::

      {'user1': ['-roleA', 'roleC'],
       }

    Effective roles for 'user1' are 'roleB' and 'roleC'.

  Blocking all previous roles of a user

    The role '-', when present, means to not acquire any roles for that
    user.

    Example::

      {'user1': ['-', 'roleC'],
       }

    Effective roles for 'user1' are 'roleC'.

  Blocking specific roles for all users

    The user '', when present, specifies rules to apply first and to all
    users.

    Example::

      {'': ['-roleA'],
       'user1': ['roleC'],
       }

    Effective roles for 'user1' are 'roleB' and 'roleC'.

  Blocking all previous roles for all users

    Example::

      {'': ['-'],
       'user1': ['roleC'],
       }

    Effective roles for 'user1' are 'roleC'.

  Group local roles

    The above also applies to groups, except that there is no way to
    block roles for all groups (the group '' has no special meaning).
